# ABOUT ME

I am passionate about developing a platform in all its forms. 
Since I was a child, technology has always been my greatest passion. I learned to work as a team during my first job, but also to take responsibility for myself by managing my department.



### WHY BLOCKCHAIN DEVELOPMENT 

Programming and finance are my passion, which led me to learn about the blockchain and I was fascinated by it. My goal is therefore to be able to facilitate and simplify people's lives through my work with this fantastic technology and beyond.
