# ABOUT ME

I'm Alan Pirro i'm a Blockchain Developer<br>
Verified by [Start2Impact](https://www.start2impact.it/master/blockchain-development/)<br>
<br>

Since I was a child, technology and computer science have always been my greatest passion, making me tinker with any device to understand its functionality.

After graduating in electro-mechanical maintenance, I started working as a programmer and machinist for CNC machines, then I approached finance and Blockchain technology and I understood that I wanted to become a developer in this area.

In my studies in Start2Impact I carried out 5 practical projects corrected by professionals in the sector, acquiring skills such as:
- Python 
- Django
- Redis
- MongoDB
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS 
- Solidity 
- Web3
