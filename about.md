# ABOUT ME

Alan Pirro<br>
Blockchain Developer<br>
Verified by [Start2Impact](https://www.start2impact.it/master/blockchain-development/)<br>
<br>
I am passionate about developing a platform in all its forms.<br> 
Since I was a child, technology has always been my greatest passion. I learned to work as a team during my first job, but also to take responsibility for myself by managing my department.<br>

### WHY BLOCKCHAIN DEVELOPMENT 

Programming and finance are my passion, which led me to learn about the blockchain and I was fascinated by it. My goal is therefore to be able to facilitate and simplify people's lives through my work with this fantastic technology and beyond.<br>
